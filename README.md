# Business/Workday Planner !

This challenge was given by The University of Minnesota Bootcamp 

These CSS, HTML, and JavaScript documents, use local storage, styling, and user input to create an hourly planner.

### This project has the following features: 
* Timeblocks
* A _save button_ for each timeblock
* _Color-coded_ timeblock hours
* _Local Storage_

### Color coding
* Timeblock of _current_ hour, will be yellow
* Timeblocks of _past_ hours, will be light blue
* Timeblock of _future_ hours, will be dark blue

### Extra add-ons

###### I enjoy adding quality of life (qol) functions to assignments, time permitting. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to bring them to life on this assignment.

* Automatic _list styling_ for the timeblocks + _flex_ so you can add more than 2 lines of text per block.

* One simple _Add event_ card per timeblock (would contain more details you could enter about said event.)

*P.S This project is extremely rebuildable and has been built many times, so, go check out my psuedocode!! I go into more depth with the innerworkings/how I constructed the app personally*
